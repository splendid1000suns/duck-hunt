 # duck-hunt
⭐️ Contains all the files for Duck Hunt, a game I remade in R5RS as a personal project. ⭐️

### Info
For the 1st year CS Bachelor course, a 2D video game had to be developed — in this case, the game 'Duck Hunt' was chosen. The programming language used was R5RS (a version of Lisp).

The game was built entirely from scratch, using a primitive graphics engine capable of displaying images and drawing rectangles at various values. A time function for the game loop and support for keyboard and mouse input were also given. Everything except for the 'graphics' module was written from scratch. Features include moving birds, varied bird behaviour, the ability to shoot birds, and applying effects using different types of guns. The game also includes a level and round system. Programming followed an object-oriented approach by defining objects as procedures and enabling them to communicate via message passing. All of the images and graphics used in the game are fully original and made by the developer using AI tools.

‘Preview’ contains a video demonstration of the game. The game can be played by downloading the files, unpacking them, and opening them in the 'DrRacket' application.

‘Duck Hunt Report’ includes a detailed explanation of the code, focusing primarily on the use of ADTs (abstract data types). The project totals around 1700 lines of code.
